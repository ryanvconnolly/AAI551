# AAI 551: Engineering Programming: Python 

## Course Description
This course presents tools, techniques, algorithms, and programming techniques using the
Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The
course formally introduces techniques to: (i) gather, (ii) store, and (iii) process large volumes of data to make informed decisions. Such techniques find applicability in many engineering
application areas, including communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids,
robotics, Internet, and enterprise networks, or any network where information flows and alters
decision making
