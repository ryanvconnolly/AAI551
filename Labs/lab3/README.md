# Lab 3: Conditionals, Loops, & Randoms

## Goals for this lab:
1. Use if, elif, else statements to allow the program to take different actions depending on input
2. Use Unicode values to output particular symbols
3. Use the random module and function to generate random numbers in a range
4. Convert text data input into numeric data using appropriate functions
5. Use while loops to allow the program to repeatedly execute the same instructions
6. Use for loops to allow the program to repeatedly execute the same instructions
7. Write and execute simple Python programs using the given instructions

### romanNumerals.py
This program converts digits into Roman numerals.

### batterUp.py
This program will simulate a batters hit using the random module.

### uncertainty.py
This program will play a position guessing game with the user.

### oddSums.py
This program finds the sum of all odd numbers between two randomly generated numbers.
