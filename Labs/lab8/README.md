# Lab 8: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Goals for this lab: 
• Create a class that is inherited by another class
• Call a superclass’s construction from a subclass’s constructor
• Override a superclass’s functions in a subclass
• Use polymorphism to allow the same function to be called by different classes
• Use isinstance() to distinguish between classes
• Write and execute Python programs using the given instructions
