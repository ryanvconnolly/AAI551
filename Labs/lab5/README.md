# Lab 5: Lists

## Goals for this Lab:
1. Use a single dimensional List to store data
2. Add, remove, and search for data in a List
3. Use for loops to allow the program to iterate through a List
4. Use a multi-dimensional, or nested, List to store data
5. Use the matplotlib.pyplot module to plot a line graph using Lists
6. Use Jupyter Notebook to examine data and execute instructions
7. Write and execute simple Python programs using the given instructions

### trebuchet.py
This program record the distances a projectile flies for a number of trials, keeping track of the 3 trials with the furthest distance using lists.

### labManager.py
This program designates space and funding to 5 pieces of lab equipment at a time and allows the user to add equipment up to that max, 
remove equipment owned by the lab, and display what is currently owned. 

### muons.py
This program simulates an array of CRMD's on a 2D map, finds the location of the highest capture rate and the location with the lowest 
capture rate and then outputs the entire map grid.

### tempGraph.py
This program generates random temps for a series of cities, stores them in lists, and creates a graph using the lists.
