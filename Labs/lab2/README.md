# Lab 2: Python Basics

## Goals for this lab: 
1. Write a simple program that takes in user input and outputs formatted text to the screen
2. Identify and correct errors in a Python program
3. Write a program that performs multiple mathematical operations
4. Convert text data input numeric data using appropriate functions
5. Write and execute simple Python programs using the PyCharm IDE

### fullName.py
Takes the first and last name of the user as input and outputs the full name in desired format.

### lineSlope.py
This program computes the slope of a line given the end points of the line. The result is then printed to the screen.

### motion.py
Given a duration of time, this program computes the velocity, average velocity, and displacement of an object. 

### motionInput.py
 Given a duration of time, this program computes the velocity, average velocity, and displacement of an object using user input.
